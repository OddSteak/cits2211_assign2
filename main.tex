\section*{Question 2}
\subsection*{a)}

the relation is reflexive if $\forall x \in \mathbb{R} ((x,  x) \in R)$ \\
subtrating any real number by itself results in zero which is an integer, Hence
R is reflexive. \\
\\
The relation is symmetric if for all $(x, y) \in R$, $(y, x) \in R$ if $x \neq y$
we need to show that if x - y is an integer, y - x is an integer as well
%
\begin{align*}
    \text{let } x - y &= k \text{ where } x \in \mathbb{Z} \\
    y - x &= -k  \text{ (arithmetic)}
\end{align*}
%
k is an integer so -k is an integer as \\
hence, y - x is an integer \\
Therefore, we have proved that is $(x, y) \in R$ then $(y, x) \in R$
and relation R is symmetric
\\
The relation R is transitive if for all $x, y, z \in \mathbb{R}$ if xRy and yRz then xRz holds \\
so we need to prove that if $x - y \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $y - z \in \mathbb{Z}$ then $x - z \in \mathbb{Z}$
%
\begin{align*}
    \text{let } x - y &= k_{1} \text{ where $k_{1}$ is an integer} \\
    \text{let } y - z &= k_{2} \text{ where $k_{2}$ is an integer} \\
    x - z &= (x - y) + (y - z) \text{  (adding and substracting y)} \\
    &= k_{1} + k_{2}
\end{align*}
both $k_{1}$ and $k_{2}$ are integers so $k_{1} + k_{2}$ is integer as well,
so x - z is an integer and $(x, z) \in R$ and the relation R is transitive \\
\\
Q.E.D.

\subsection*{b)}
\textbf{i.} \\
the equivalence class of any real number x is given by \\
$[x] = \{y \in \mathbb{R} \;|\; y - x \in \mathbb{Z}\}$ \\
let y - x be an integer k then y = x + k \\
Therefore, the equivalence class of any real number x consists of all numbers
produced by adding an integer to x
since the numbers integers is infinite, each equivalence class is infinite
\\ \\
\textbf{ii.} \\
as proved in part \textbf{i} every real number has an equivalence classes therefore,
the total number of equivalence classes are infinite.

            \node at (axis cs:\kone,\ktwo) {$\piValue$};

\subsection*{b)}
The function $\pi$ is bijection between $\mathbb{N}^2$ and $\mathbb{N}$ \\
We need to prove that there exists a bijection between $\mathbb{N}^n$ and $\mathbb{N}$ \\

\section*{Question 5}
We need to prove that a bijection from $B$ to $A^B$ doesn't exist \\
assume a bijection f from $B$ to $A^B$ exists \\
for every $x \in B$, $f(x) \in A^B$. f(x) is a function from B to A. \\
Now, we can define new function $f^\prime$ such that
$f^\prime (x) \neq (f(x))(x)$ \\
since, $|A| > 2$ we can define this function by choosing a different value from set
$A$ for every value of $x \in B$ \\
the function f is a bijection so there must be some value of $x \in B$ such that
$f(x) = f^\prime$ \\
\\
This contradicts with the definition of $f^\prime$ function since this would imply
that $f(x)(y) = f^\prime(y)$ for all $y \in B$ \\
our assumption that f is a bijection must be false
Therefore, a bijection from set $B$ to $A^B$ doesn't exist and $|A^B| \neq |B|$. \\
Q.E.D.

\section*{Question 6}
\subsection*{a)}
\textbf{States:} $Q = \{q_1, q_2, q_3\}$ \\
\textbf{Start state:} $q_0 = q_1$ \\
\textbf{Alphabet:} $\Sigma = \{0, 1\}$ \\
\textbf{Accepting states:} $F = \{q_1, q_3\}$ \\
\textbf{State transition:} $\delta : Q \times \Sigma -> \mathcal{P}(Q)$ \\

\subsection*{b)}
FSM recognises the symbols 1 and 0
\begin{itemize}
    \item $q_1$ is the starting state and it stays there if it reads 0 and moves to $q_2$ if it reads 1
    \item in state $q_2$ it doesn't move if it reads 0 and moves to $q_3$ if it reads 1
    \item in state $q_3$ it only accepts the symbol 0 and stays in $q_3$
\end{itemize}
states $q_1$ and $q_3$ are the accepting states \\
Thus, the FSM accepts strings that contain exactly two 1s and any number of 0s including none anywhere

\subsection*{c)}
0*10*10*

\section*{Question 7}
\textbf{States:} \\
set of States of the DFSM is the powerset of the states of the original NFSM \\
$Q = \{\phi, \{q_0\}, \{q_1\}, \{q_0, q_1\}\}$ \\
\\
\textbf{Initial state:} \\
The initial state of the DFSM is a singleton set containing the initial state of the NFSM \\
$\{q_0\}$ is the initial state \\
\\
\textbf{Accepting states:} \\
accepting states of the DFSM are the states containing any accepting states of NFSM \\
$\{q_1\}$ and $\{q_0, q_1\}$ are the accepting states \\
\\
\textbf{The Transition Function:} \\
The transition function, $\delta$ , returns the union of all states that are
reachable via the original transition function $\delta'$ , by consuming the
input from any of the NFSM states in the current DFSM state, i.e.,
$\delta(s, x) = \bigcup \{ \delta'(q, x) \mid q \in s \}$

The Result could be simpliefied by removing the state $\{q_1\}$ since there is no way
to reach the state and it's part of the combined state $\{q_0, q_1\}$

\section*{Question 8}
\subsection*{a)}
b*ab*aab*aaab*

\subsection*{b)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item ((11)*)1*)* can be simplified to 1* since (11)* means even number of
          1s and the 1* provides additional 1s which means an empty string
          of any string made of 1s is accepted
    \item (11 + 1)* can be simplified to 1* because 11* would be even number of
        1s and 1* would make any number of 1s including none.
    \item (0 + $\epsilon$)* can be simplified to 0* since $\epsilon$* can be
        covered by no zeroes included in 0*
    \item the expression can be further simplified by combining 1* + 1* to 1*
\end{itemize}
final expression is 1* + 0*
